# System for automatic size and type control of cars rims

## Abstract

At the end of every automotive assembly line, there is a quality control
process where factory workers check produced cars for potential defects. The
computer vision field, especially neural networks for images, have great potential to complement human staff in order to produce as safe and reliable cars as
possible. In this thesis we focus on the validation, whether all four wheels on a
single car match in size and type. We introduce and experiment with both neural
networks and traditional computer vision techniques. The approach we use is to
first detect the car then classify its wheels and try to estimate their size. In the
end we build a functional prototype of the system that is running in real-time.
The data for this thesis were recorded in Skoda Auto factory in Mlada Boleslav
in cooperation with the company.
